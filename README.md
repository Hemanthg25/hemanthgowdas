## 🌐 About Me  
I’m an enthusiastic and detail-oriented **Network Engineer** with a deep interest in routing, switching, and enterprise infrastructure.  
My focus lies in building robust, secure, and efficient network architectures. I enjoy exploring how advanced routing protocols and redundancy mechanisms enhance connectivity and reliability.  

Having completed my **Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)** certification, I’m currently working toward **CCNP Enterprise**, and my long-term goal is to earn the **CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure** credential.  
I’m passionate about hands-on practice using simulation tools such as **Cisco Packet Tracer**, **GNS3**, and **Wireshark** to bring theoretical concepts into real-world network scenarios.

## 🧠 Networking Knowledge  

### 🛰️ Switching & Layer 2 Technologies  
- VLANs, Trunking, and Inter-VLAN Routing for network segmentation  
- STP, RSTP, and MSTP to prevent broadcast loops  
- EtherChannel (PAgP, LACP) for link aggregation  
- VTP, DTP, and Native VLAN management  
- Port Security and Switch Hardening for improved protection  

### 📡 Routing & Layer 3 Technologies  
- Static and Default Routing  
- Dynamic Routing: OSPF (Single & Multi-Area), EIGRP configuration  
- Route Summarization and Redistribution  
- Passive Interfaces, Loopback Interfaces setup  
- Redundancy techniques using HSRP, VRRP, and GLBP  

### 🧱 Network Services  
- DHCP, DNS, and NAT implementation  
- SNMP, Syslog, and NTP configuration  
- Access Control Lists (ACLs) for security and traffic control  

### 🧩 Troubleshooting Tools  
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** for network simulation  
- **GNS3** for complex enterprise labs  
- **Wireshark** for real-time packet capture and protocol analysis

## 🧪 Practical Projects (Ongoing)  

Here are some practical labs and configurations I’m currently experimenting with:  

- 🧩 **VLAN & Trunking Lab** — Implemented VLANs and 802.1Q trunks for traffic segregation  
- 🔁 **HSRP Redundancy Lab** — Configured dual-router gateway failover for high availability  
- 🔄 **OSPF Multi-Area Network** — Designed dynamic routing between segmented subnets  
- ⚙️ **EtherChannel Aggregation** — Enhanced throughput and redundancy using multiple links  
- 🧱 **Spanning Tree Optimization** — Simulated root bridge elections and network recovery events  
- 📘 **Upcoming:** Advanced CCIE-Level Enterprise Infrastructure Simulations
